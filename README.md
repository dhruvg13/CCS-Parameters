# CCS parameter Prediction System

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing pellet properties to identify and address factors impacting Cold Crushing Strength (CSS), a critical parameter in the quality control of iron ore pellets. During the internship at Jindal, a systematic approach was adopted using Python, Excel, and data visualization tools to uncover patterns and support decision-making. A predictio model was also developed to find out parameters and visualize CSS trends effectively.

## Project Objective

- Analyze historical production data to understand variations in CSS.
- Identify key parameters influencing pellet strength.
- Develop visual tools for continuous monitoring and performance evaluation.
- Suggest process improvements based on data-driven insights.
